                        <p>
                            Users can document the small gestures they make for their loved ones. Documenting everyday actions
                            that are often forgotten or dismissed as insignificant.
                            This feature addresses the feeling of “I do so much, but it’s never noticed” by giving small acts a
                            permanent place.

                        <p>
                            Love Bytes allow users to send regular, low-pressure check-ins to their partner. Sharing what
                            they’re doing and how they
                            feel in the moment.
                            This reduces the emotional gap created by silence and helps partners feel thought of, even during
                            routine moments.

                            Gentle reminders encourage users to engage in small acts of care consistently.
                            Not to optimize productivity, but to support being emotionally intentional.
                            These reminders act as nudges toward presence, not obligation.
