        <h2>The Grand Gesture Myth</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “We often wait for anniversaries or milestones to express our
            devotion, yet grand gestures often overshadow the quite moments that
            truly matter.”
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          It is the steady, silent rhythm of small acts – the brewing of tea,
          the holding of a hand, the remembering of a minor detail – that builds
          the foundation of a lasting bond. These micro-acts of care are the
          invisible threads holding everything together.

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>Here are our core features to help with the micro-acts of care.</p>

            <h3>Take Notes</h3>
            <p>
              Users can document the small gestures they make for their loved
              ones. Documenting everyday actions that are often forgotten or
              dismissed as insignificant. This feature addresses the feeling of
              “I do so much, but it’s never noticed” by giving small acts a
              permanent place.

            <h3>Love Bytes</h3>
            <p>
              Love Bytes allow users to send regular, low-pressure check-ins to
              their partner. Sharing what they’re doing and how they feel in the
              moment. This reduces the emotional gap created by silence and
              helps partners feel thought of, even during routine moments.

            <h3>Reminders</h3>
            <p>
              Gentle reminders encourage users to engage in small acts of care
              consistently. Not to optimize productivity, but to support being
              emotionally intentional. These reminders act as nudges toward
              presence, not obligation.
